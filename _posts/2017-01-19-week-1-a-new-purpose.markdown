Welcome to the first post of this blog. The purpuse here is to continously 
update the progress made in our bachelor thesis project:

## IMP Engine, What is it?
IMP Engine stands for Interactive Molecular Physics Engine and it is a 
Physics engine that simulates materials by approximating them as 
particles (molecules) in real time (interactive).

The first week held our first meeting with our supervisor, Marco, which 
kicked of our project with lots of reading.

This week has been riddled with illness, Pontus has been sick for 
the whole week and Adam has felt a cold coming through the latter part. 
Love has finished his three day laboration event. For the project, 
there is now actual simulation happening. There is a basic collision 
with the floor implemented through clamping of particle positions and 
there is also constraints created for the box model. The work on actual 
collision between particles has been brought to a working level, 
and the collision between particles and triangle has seen some progress.

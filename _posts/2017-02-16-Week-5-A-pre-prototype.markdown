This week have mainly focused around coding and implementing some kind of basic 
environment to use as a base for future work. We’ve mainly implemented the 
mentioned scene (wireframe box) and made some progress on the camera and rendering 
of particles, but the latter was delayed heavily due to problems with getting 
shaders to work. Hopefully this will be mitigated now when we have proper working 
shaders for the scene. Patrick has made good progress on a basic skeleton implementation 
of the simulation loop and has also added some constraints. 

On thursday, during our weekly meeting we mostly took care of some more administrational 
issues regarding the course work, such as booking a time for the info-lab. We also 
started to look for a group to collaborate with for the first supervisory laboration 
provided by Fackspråk. Additionally we decided that Adam and Patrick would handle the 
halftime presentation and that Pontus and Love would take care of the oral part of the opposition.

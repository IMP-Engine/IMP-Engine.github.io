Returning focus on the project, we have started looking at parallelizing 
the application using Intel TBB. Additionally, the work on collision has 
been merged into the core develop branch. Generally, the application works 
very well. We fixed a minor issue in how the gravity was calculated. There 
was a bigger refactor made of the code as the code base is starting to 
grow and work on how performance calculated is displayed. Looking forward, 
we also started work on changing the structure of how particle data is 
represented in the code.

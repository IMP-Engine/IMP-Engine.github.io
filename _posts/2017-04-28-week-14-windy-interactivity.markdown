title:  "Week 14: Windy interactivity"

This week was more productive. We introduced interactivity in 
the form of being able to throw a small cube and a small 
wind-like (sideways) force was added. GS vs Jacobi was finalized 
and graphs produced. We also made some serious work on 
parallelisation and optimizing collision detection using 
grid or an so called octree.

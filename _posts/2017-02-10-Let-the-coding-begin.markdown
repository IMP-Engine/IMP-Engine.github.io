We started setting up the project each of the members computer. We had some issues 
getting CMake to work correctly on everyone's computer (Windows and Ubuntu). 
We started implementing basic building blocks such as basic rendering (Pontus), 
simple gui and error handling (Patrick) and generation of a box of particles (Adam). 

On the weekly thursday meeting we decided on next week’s challenges to implement. 
They are: A bounding box for the scene (room), a rotating camera, a particle renderer, 
collisions and an early version of the constraints and simulation loop. We also 
decided to start using github’s issue system to organize what need doing and who 
is doing what. The reason for this is that as we’re using github anyway, it is 
good to have some organisation in close proximity. We brought up using some kind 
of agile board (Waffle.io/Trello), but decided to wait and try just using the github 
issue system first. Some minor coding standard things were discussed, such as naming conventions.

We ended the meeting with sending in the project planning report that were finalized 
last meeting. We have not received any feedback on it from Marco, who is currently away on a conference.

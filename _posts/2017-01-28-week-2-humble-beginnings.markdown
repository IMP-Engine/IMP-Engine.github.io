The week has been dominated by reading different papers concerning the physical 
background on different teqniques we might want to use. Once again we met with marco,
but this time we went into more detail about what the goal of the engine is. 

The initial goal is to make a prototype that is capable of simulating boxes of 
deformable material.

We also decided to make use of the GUI library for C++ called ["Dear imgui,"][imgui], 
which in turn means we will use [GLFW][glfw] as the utility/window managing library.

This week a lot of nice features have been added.

Rendering of surfaces have come another step closer to being finished.

The program solves constraints parallel. Speedup factor is rougly 2-3x on a 4core machine.

It is now possible to add more than one object to the scene.

Collision constraints are now used to handle collisions response
and there is friction.

title:  "Week 17: Presentation preparation"

This week was dominated by the presentation which will 
happen next week, but also the opposition of another group. 
Their report was in quite a bad shape and felt rushed, as 
if they had focused more on development. We felt quite 
bad about turning in a several pages long list of corrections, 
but we hope that their report benefitted from it. On tuesday 
there was a minor exhibition done, but this felt somewhat 
useless as there were only other thesis students there.

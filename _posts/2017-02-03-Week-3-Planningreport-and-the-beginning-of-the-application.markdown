The group met up and sat down to write the project planning report, create a tentative time schedule as well as to discuss about different project related issues. We decided to split the project into several prototypes. The reason for this is that it gives up a few clear milestones to work against during the project. 

We also defined some features as additional, meaning that we are not focusing on them initially, but rather these are features that will be made if time allows. We settled on a scrum like agile type of project method, because we feel that there is some uncertainty in implementation and a short sprint-like iterative process will be very beneficial to the project.
Patrick created a preliminary multi-platform building environment, but it has yet to be used by the other group members. He also added “GLFW”, “glad” and “dear imgui” to the basic application which now opens a window. The group has continued to research the subject of the project and learning the various tools (CMake, Visual studio, Make, etc) and techniques/libraries needed.

Week 7 was mostly dominated by one part the halftime presentation and one part 
the first so called “Handledningstillfälle 1” (Tutorial opportunity 1) given by
“Language and Communication” (Fackspråk och kommunikation) at Chalmers. The 
halftime presentation was given by Adam and Patrick, and was an overall success. 
The tutorial opportunity has yet to happen at the time of writing (thursday), 
but the preparatory work has almost been completed. The text we are tasked to 
criticize is a project planning report for an experiment with the aim of 
successfully producing yeast that can survive at 40°C, and is made from a group 
of student from the chemical department at chalmers. 

Regarding the state of our own application, we have made some progress on collision. 
Rendering of particles has been almost completed, even though there are some bugs 
remaining. There has also been some work done to introduce stability in the simulation.
